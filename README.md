# Be4stBoardBot
The original Be4stSie soundboard, but on Discord!

# Discord Bot
This is the Discord version of Be4stBoard, it will never work as good as the [website], but it allows for fun interacions between users in the server.

## Why?
Good question! Honestly, I don't know. I wanted to make a Discord bot again, since I wanted to learn how to work with the new things. (I didn't do anything on Discord bots since slash commands, buttons, etc.)

## A note on development
It is not fully ready to be used. Yes, it is functional, but there still has a lot of work to do to make it easyily usable. I won't garantee that it will ever be finished, but hey, the version currently up works!

# Never-Asked-Questions (NAQ)
Since no one asked me questions, I'll answer them here.

## Where can I invite it?
You can't. This will be a self-hosted bot, since I don't intend to use it on a day-to-day basis. Besides that, it is a really specific bot, so probably no server wants to use this exact version.

## Can I use it anyway?
Yes you can! And it's also completely free! [Here][wiki] you can find information on how to use it!
